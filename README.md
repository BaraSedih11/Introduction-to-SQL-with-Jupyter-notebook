This repository contains an implementing how to work with SQL on Jupyter notebook in python.

## Overview

In this repository, we demonstrate how to perform SQL queries using Python on Jypyter notebook. We utilize libraries such as pandas and sqlalchemy. Additionally, we provide a simple example along with explanations to help you understand how to apply SQL queries to your own datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- SQLAlchemy
- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas sqlalchemy

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Introduction-to-SQL-with-Jupyter-notebook.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Introduction-to-SQL-with-Jupyter-notebook
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how decision trees is implemented using Python.
